Example for the python script in level2.py:
- Transfer Learning (TL) significantly improves the performance of Algorithm 2
- Algorithm 1 does not benefit from TL, likely because it already performs well without it
- After applying TL, both algorithms perform similarly -> TL helps bridge the performance gap
- Assumption: Transfer Learning may be especially beneficial for weaker models
